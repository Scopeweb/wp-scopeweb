                    <h1>Some say agency - we say team</h1>
                    <p>Scope Web is an agency of designers, developers and content makers based in New York City &amp; The Netherlands. We‚Äôre in the heart of the city, but don‚Äôt be fooled, over half of our clients are suburban based and we understand the difference.</p>
                    <p>
                        We‚Äôre not tied down to any one specific sector either, and we like it that way. It gives us a broader range of work to flex our creative muscles! After all, being creative is about solving a problem.</p>
                    <p>We offer a full range of services and can help you from the very creation of an idea through to delivery and on-going support. So whether it‚Äôs a brand and a campaign roll out, or a website design and build, we help you shape it.</p>

                <p>We define ourselves by the work we produce. Everything has a purpose and it plays an important part in the work we create as a team. The skills and techniques we have learnt and the experiences we have gained throughout the years play a part in what we do.</p>
                <p>To some, craft may be a strange word to use when talking about design in the modern sense. Craft is usually associated with traditional techniques such as carpentry or ironmongery. But in its essence, it‚Äôs about the care, skill, knowledge and technique in producing a final piece of work. Our tools may be different, but it‚Äôs these core elements that make us the same, and in that sense, we‚Äôre not unlike those traditional craftsmen after all.</p>

                <p>Tucked away behind our computers we're a fully remote team. We're lucky to have an amazing team that has strong communication and cultural differences that allow us to communicate with any client efficiently and respectfully.</p>
                <p>The fact that you spend most of your life at work means it needs to be a place that you enjoy. Gone are the days of being glued to your desk. Some of our best ideas and thoughts have come from a chat in our library, a stroll in the nearby orchards, or after a heated game of Fortnite.</p>
